This repository contains the source code for a web-based binary tree builder. The application allows users to create binary trees by entering node values and visualizing the structure.

Features:

Node Creation: Users can add nodes to the tree by entering root, left child, and right child values.
Tree Building: The application constructs the binary tree based on the entered values.
Visualization: The binary tree is visually represented using a tree diagram.
Information Display: The root, left child, right child, and tree height are displayed.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data structure manipulations, and visualization of the binary tree.
